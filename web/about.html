        <p>Arthur and Buster are playing with action figures in Buster's house. Buster accuses Arthur of breaking his
            "Mackerelman" action figure, so they begin to argue. Suddenly, a game show called Riddle Quest, hosted by
            Alex Lebek, starts on TV and they stop arguing to watch the show. Arthur has never heard about the show, so
            Buster tells him about it: two kids answer riddles to earn points, before answering a 'Really Big Riddle' to
            determine the winner of the show; the loser receives a consolation prize of 100 boxes of 'Choco Sticks'
            chocolate bars. Buster states that the reigning champion is a girl called Charlotte Bickles, who has been
            appearing on the show for weeks. However, when Arthur answers three of the riddles correctly before
            Charlotte, including the final question, Buster begins to believe that Arthur would be a good contestant. At
            the end of the show, an advertisement shows, prompting viewers to send a letter to Riddle Quest Studios if
            they think they are good enough to be on the show.
        </p>
        <p>Walking home, Arthur ridicules this idea of appearing on the show, but Buster still posts an addressed letter
            with the name "Arthur Read" in the mailbox to the studios.
        </p>
        <p> Mr. Higgins eventually delivers Buster's letter to Riddle Quest Studios. While Mr. Alex Lebek is getting his
            hair cut, a mail deliverer brings a bag of letters into the room and Mr. Lebek randomly picks a letter out
            of it. He dismissively selects Arthur as the contestant.
        </p>
        <p> Arthur receives an application letter from Riddle Quest Studios, and Buster is thrilled that Arthur is going
            to be on the show, along with Arthur's other friends.
        </p>
        <p> D.W. brings Arthur to the Tibbles' house so he can be trained for his appearance on the show. However, the
            Tibbles just give him mediocre riddles, which Arthur easily guesses. However, he becomes annoyed and
            believes that such riddles won't be similar enough to those on the show.
